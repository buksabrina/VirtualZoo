        <h2>Sharks</h2>
        <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. They are known for their keen sense of smell and their role as top predators in the ocean.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Sharks inhabit all the world's oceans and can be found in various environments from shallow coastal areas to the deep sea. Some species, like the bull shark, can even swim in freshwater. They prefer a range of temperatures depending on the species, from tropical and temperate waters to cold polar seas.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Sharks are generally carnivorous and have diverse diets depending on the species. Their prey includes fish, crustaceans, mollusks, marine mammals, and other sharks. Some species, like the great white shark, are apex predators, while others, like the whale shark, are filter feeders consuming plankton and small fish.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>Shark sizes vary greatly among species. The smallest shark, the dwarf lanternshark, is about 17 cm (6.7 inches) long, while the largest, the whale shark, can reach lengths of up to 12 meters (40 feet). Most shark species are between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7 feet) long.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>Shark populations are facing significant threats due to overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change. Many species are considered vulnerable or endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect shark populations through regulations, marine protected areas, and international agreements.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Shark FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Are sharks dangerous to humans?</b> While shark attacks on humans do occur, they are extremely rare. Most sharks are not dangerous to humans and prefer to avoid contact.
        <br></br>
    <b>How do sharks breathe?</b> Sharks breathe through gills located on the sides of their heads. Water flows over the gills, allowing them to extract oxygen from the water.
