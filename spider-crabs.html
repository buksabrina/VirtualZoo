        <h2>Spider Crabs</h2>
        <p>Spider crabs are a group of marine crabs known for their long legs and their ability to blend into their surroundings. They are found in oceans around the world and are known for their unique appearance and impressive size.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Spider crabs inhabit a variety of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. They are commonly found on rocky and sandy sea floors, coral reefs, and among seagrass beds. Some species prefer colder waters, while others can be found in more temperate regions.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Spider crabs are omnivorous scavengers, feeding on a wide range of food sources. Their diet includes algae, detritus, small invertebrates, and dead animals. They use their claws to pick apart their food and are known to clean up the ocean floor by consuming carrion.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>The size of spider crabs varies significantly among species. The Japanese spider crab is the largest, with a leg span of up to 3.8 meters (12 feet) and a body size of about 40 cm (16 inches). Other species are much smaller, with leg spans typically ranging from a few centimeters to over a meter.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>Spider crab populations are generally stable, though they can be affected by overfishing and habitat destruction in some areas. Conservation efforts are important to ensure their populations remain healthy, especially for larger species like the Japanese spider crab.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Spider Crab FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Why are they called spider crabs?</b> Spider crabs get their name from their long, spindly legs that resemble those of a spider. Their appearance helps them blend into their environment and avoid predators.
        <br></br>
    <b>Are spider crabs dangerous?</b> Spider crabs are not dangerous to humans. They are generally slow-moving and use their long legs and camouflage to avoid threats rather than engaging in aggressive behavior.
