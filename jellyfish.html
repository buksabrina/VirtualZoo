        <h2>Jellyfish</h2>
        
        <p>Jellyfish are soft-bodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles. They are known for their beautiful, translucent appearance and their ability to sting.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. They inhabit a variety of marine environments, including coastal areas, open oceans, and even the abyssal zones. Some jellyfish species can also survive in freshwater.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Jellyfish are carnivorous, feeding primarily on small fish, plankton, and other marine invertebrates. They use their tentacles to capture prey, injecting venom through specialized cells called nematocysts. The captured prey is then brought to their mouths for digestion.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>Jellyfish sizes can vary greatly depending on the species. The smallest jellyfish, such as the Irukandji, can be as small as 1 cm (0.4 inches) in diameter, while the largest, the lion's mane jellyfish, can have a bell diameter of up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) and tentacles that can stretch over 30 meters (100 feet) long.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>Jellyfish populations can fluctuate widely due to various factors such as water temperature, salinity, and the availability of prey. Some areas have seen increases in jellyfish populations, which can impact local ecosystems and human activities. However, exact population numbers are difficult to determine due to their wide distribution and varying habitats.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Jellyfish FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Do all jellyfish sting?</b> While most jellyfish have stinging cells, not all species are harmful to humans. Some jellyfish stings can cause mild discomfort, while others can be more dangerous and require medical attention.
        <br></br>
    <b>How do jellyfish move?</b> Jellyfish move by contracting and relaxing their bell, which pushes water behind them and propels them forward. This movement is called jet propulsion.
