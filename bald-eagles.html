        <h2>Bald Eagles</h2>
        <p>The bald eagle is a bird of prey found in North America. It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of America, known for its striking white head and tail feathers contrasting with its dark brown body and wings.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Bald eagles are typically found near large bodies of open water with abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. They inhabit a range of environments from forests and mountains to swamps and marshes. They are most commonly found in Alaska, Canada, and the contiguous United States, particularly near rivers and large lakes.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Bald eagles are opportunistic feeders with a diet primarily consisting of fish. They also eat waterfowl, small mammals, carrion, and occasionally steal food from other animals. Their excellent vision allows them to spot prey from a distance while flying or perched high in a tree.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>Adult bald eagles have a wingspan ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 meters (6 to 7.5 feet) and weigh between 3 to 6.3 kg (6.6 to 13.9 pounds). Females are generally larger than males, which is common among birds of prey.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>The bald eagle population has recovered significantly since the 20th century due to conservation efforts, including banning harmful pesticides like DDT. Today, their numbers are stable, with an estimated 300,000 individuals in North America. They are no longer considered endangered but are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Bald Eagle FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Can Bald Eagles swim?</b> Yes, bald eagles can swim. They use their wings to propel themselves through the water if they catch a fish that is too heavy to lift directly out of the water.
        <br></br>
    <b>How long do Bald Eagles live?</b> In the wild, bald eagles typically live 20 to 30 years, but they can live longer in captivity with some reaching up to 50 years old.
