        <h2>Sea Otters</h2>
       
        <p>Sea otters are marine mammals capable of living their entire lives in the ocean. They are known for their playful behavior and their use of tools to open shells.</p>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Sea otters inhabit coastal waters, usually less than half a mile from shore. They like dense kelp forests, barrier reefs, tidewater shores, and rocky shores.Sea otters can be found in California, Washington, Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Japan. <br></br>
        Southern sea otters can be found along California's central coast, from San Mateo County in the north to near Santa Barbara in the south. Northern sea otters are found along the coast of Alaska and Washington, and Russian otters are found in the Pacific Ocean off Russia and Japan.</p>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Their diet includes clams, crabs, sea urchins, starfish, abalone, and 40 different marine invertebrates. They also eat octopuses, squid, and fish. Sea otters have a high metabolism rate and eat 25 percent of their body weight every day â€” an adult will consume 5,000 to 6,000 pounds of food annually. Otters eat while floating on their backs, using their chests as dining tables.</p>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>The southern sea otter measures up to 4 feet (1.2 m) in length; females weigh up to 50 pounds (23 kg) and males up to 70 pounds (32 kg). Northern sea otters are larger, up to 70 pounds (32 kg) for females and 100 pounds (45 kg) for males.
</p>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>The current southern sea otter population averages around 3,000 individuals.  Since the California population has a limited range and is close to human activity, they are considered endangered. </p>
        <br></br>
        
        <h3>Otter FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Can Sea Otters breathe air?</b> No! Sea otters breathe air, just like humans. To forage for food underwater, a sea otter can dive to 600 feet (183 m) and stay down for 6 to 7 minutes, although most dives are shorter and shallower.
        <br></br>
    <b>Can a sea otter live on land?</b> Although a sea otter breathes air and can climb on rocks, it depends on the ocean to survive. Its food is in the ocean, and it moves clumsily on land with its webbed back feet.
