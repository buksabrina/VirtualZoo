        <h2>Penguins</h2>
        <p>Penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds highly adapted to life in the water. They are known for their distinct black and white plumage and their upright, waddling gait.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Penguins are found mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galápagos penguin, living north of the equator. They typically inhabit coastal regions and islands, with some species like the Emperor penguin living in the icy environments of Antarctica, while others like the African penguin inhabit the temperate coastal waters of South Africa and Namibia.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Penguins primarily feed on a diet of fish, squid, and krill. Their diet varies depending on the species and their habitat, but they are expert hunters, using their flippers to swim and catch prey underwater.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>Penguin sizes vary significantly among species. The smallest, the Little Blue Penguin, stands around 40 cm (16 inches) tall and weighs about 1 kg (2.2 pounds). The largest, the Emperor Penguin, can reach heights of up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) and weigh between 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 pounds).</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>Penguin populations vary widely among species. Some populations are stable, while others are declining due to factors like climate change, overfishing, and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are in place for many species, such as the Galápagos penguin and the African penguin, to help protect and restore their numbers.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h3>Penguin FAQ</h3>
        <p><b>Can Penguins fly?</b> No, penguins are flightless birds. However, they are excellent swimmers and use their flippers to 'fly' through the water with great agility.
        <br></br>
    <b>Do Penguins live in cold environments?</b> While many penguin species, such as the Emperor and Adélie penguins, live in the cold environments of Antarctica, other species are adapted to more temperate or even tropical climates, like the Galápagos penguin.
