            <h2>Pandas</h2>
            <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are beloved black-and-white bears native to China. They are known for their distinct coloration and their diet primarily consisting of bamboo.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>Pandas inhabit temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of southwest China. They are mostly found in Sichuan province, but also inhabit areas in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Their preferred habitat is dense bamboo forests at high altitudes between 1,200 and 3,100 meters (4,000 to 10,000 feet).</p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>Though pandas are members of the Carnivora order, their diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting of 99% bamboo. They eat different parts of the bamboo depending on the season. They may also eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>Adult pandas are about 1.2 to 1.9 meters (4 to 6 feet) long, including a tail of about 10-15 cm (4-6 inches), and they typically weigh between 70 and 100 kg (150 and 220 pounds). Some exceptional individuals can weigh up to 160 kg (350 pounds).</p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>There are approximately 1,864 giant pandas living in the wild, with around 600 more pandas living in zoos and breeding centers around the world. Conservation efforts have helped to increase their population, leading to their status being updated from "Endangered" to "Vulnerable" by the IUCN.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h3>Panda FAQ</h3>
            <p><b>Can Pandas climb trees?</b> Yes, pandas are excellent climbers and often climb trees to avoid predators or to take a nap.
            <br></br>
        <b>Do Pandas hibernate?</b> Unlike some other bears, pandas do not hibernate. They are active year-round and move to lower elevations during the winter to stay warm.
